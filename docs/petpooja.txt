## Company Foundation & History

- **Founded:** 2011
- **Founders:** 
  - **Parthiv Patel** (Co-Founder & CEO)
  - **Apurv Patel** (Co-Founder & CSO - Chief Strategy Officer)
- **Headquarters:** Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India
- **Years in Operation:** 14+ years (as of 2025)
- **Employee Count:** 1,784 employees (as of August 2025)

### The Origin Story

**2011 - The Beginning:**
Parthiv and Apurv were college friends who pursued different careers after graduation. Parthiv worked in Finance while Apurv worked for a leading IT MNC in India. They coincidentally met in Ahmedabad and reconnected over their shared love for food. This sparked the idea of starting something in the food industry.

Petpooja initially started as a **corporate food delivery service** in 2011, acting as a middle-man to deliver large bulk orders of corporate meals from partner restaurants. Within 2 years, they were serving over 200 corporates in Ahmedabad and had partnered with 300+ restaurants.

**2014 - The Pivot:**
During their delivery service operations, Parthiv and Apurv realized the business was operationally intensive. They had to manually place orders, follow up constantly, manage billing, and track deliveries. This made them realize that these mundane tasks were a daily struggle for all restaurant operators, leading to increasing restaurant shutdowns.

In 2014, they **realigned their mission** to provide technological solutions to automate repetitive tasks, giving restaurant owners more time to focus on customer service and business growth. They secured seed funding from friends and family and started building the Petpooja POS software.

**Key Growth Milestones:**
- Started operations from a one-room office
- Initial team of 2 grew to 200 by 2019
- Grew to 600+ employees by 2021
- Currently 1,784 employees (2025)
